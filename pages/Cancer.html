          <h2>What is blood cancer?</h2>
          <p> Cancer is caused by a dysfunction in cellular growth and behavior.
            In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones.
             The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers.  
               </p>
               <h2>What are the symptoms of blood cancer?</h2>
               <p><b>Symptoms of blood cancer vary by disease but typically include the following:</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fever</li>
                  <li>Chills</li>

               <h2>What is lung cancer?</h2>
              <p>Lung cancer refers to different types of cancer that develop within the lungs. 
                 Like all cancers, lung cancer begins at the cellular level and causes abnormal cells in the lungs to reproduce rapidly and out of control.
                 Over time, these cells can form a mass of tissue known as a tumor. </p>
              <h2>What are the symptoms of lung cancer? </h2>
              <p><b>Most people who are diagnosed with lung cancer experience one or more of the following symptoms:</b></p>
              <ul>
               <li>Chest pain that flares up while coughing or laughing</li>
               <li>A cough that doesn't go away and that worsens over time</li>
               <li>Wheezing</li>
               <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
               <li>Hoarseness</li>
               <li>Loss of appetite </li>

            <ul>
             <li><b> Surgery :</b></li>
             An operation to remove the cancer. Surgery may not be possible if the cancer is large or has spread to other parts of the body.
             <li><b>Chemotherapy :</b></li>
             The use of special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. Chemotherapy is an important part of treatment for small cell lung cancer, regardless of the stage. 
             <li><b>Targeted therapy :</b></li>
             The use of drugs to block the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
             <li><b>Pneumonectomy :</b></li>
             In a pneumonectomy, a surgeon removes the entirety of the right or the left lung. This procedure is used if the cancer is near the center of the chest.
             </ul>
             <h2>How is lung cancer diagnosed?</h2>
             <p>To diagnose lung cancer, your doctor will obtain your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order different tests that confirm the presence of the disease. 
                Doctors also may order imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest or abdomen, to check for the presence of a tumor or mass in the lungs. </p>
                <b>If they believe that lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including the brain or bones, they may order the following:</b>
            <ul>
             <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</li>
             <li>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, often combined with a CT scan</li>
             <li>Bone scan</li>

             <h2>what is brain cancer ?</h2>
             <p>A brain tumor is a growth of cells in the brain or near it. Brain tumors can happen in the brain tissue. Brain tumors also can happen near the brain tissue. 
               Nearby locations include nerves, the pituitary gland, the pineal gland, and the membranes that cover the surface of the brain.
               Brain tumors can begin in the brain. These are called primary brain tumors. Sometimes, cancer spreads to the brain from other parts of the body. 
               These tumors are secondary brain tumors, also called metastatic brain tumors.
            </p>
              <h2>What are the symptoms of brain tumors?</h2>
              <p><b>Symptoms can vary widely depending on the part of the brain that's involved. 
               Some patients have no symptoms at all. But, for those who do, symptoms may include, but are not limited to:</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Headache</li>
                  <li>Seizures</li>
                  <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                  <li>Weakness</li>
                  <li>Dizziness</li>
                  <li>Numbness or tingling</li>
                  <li>Difficulty with walking or movement</li>
                 </ul>
         <p><b>Children may experience some additional symptoms that may include:</b></p>
         <ul>
            <li>Enlarged head (in babies)</li>
            <li>Developmental delays</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
            <li>Ongoing irritability</li>
            <li>Diminished learning ability</li>

         <ul>
            <li> <b>Surgery :</b></li>
            Surgery is often the first line of treatment for brain tumors. The goal for most primary brain tumors is to remove as much of the tumor as safely as possible while preserving, or even improving, brain function.
            <li> <b>Chemotherapy :</b></li>
            These drugs are typically used following surgery for more aggressive, malignant brain tumors, and are usually used in combination with radiation as part of the “standard of care”.
            <li><b>Radiation therapy :</b></li>
            Various types of radiation can also be used to target and treat brain tumors, depending on the number, size, location, and type of brain tumor involved.
            <li><b>Other drugs :</b></li>
            such as corticosteroids and anti-seizure drugs, are commonly used to reduce swelling and seizure risk, respectively.
         </ul>
            <h2>How are brain tumors diagnosed ?</h2>
            <p>Doctors can perform a series of tests to diagnose suspected brain tumors.
               diagnostic imaging studies (most commonly MRI or CT scan) are often obtained to better understand whether a tumor exists, and if it does, to evaluate its location, size, and effect on surrounding tissue.
