        <h1>JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES WE PROVIDE</h1></center>
        <p>At WELLNESS HOSPITAL, we offer a variety of joint replacement surgeries to meet the unique needs of our patients. Our expert team of surgeons specializes in the following procedures:</p><hr>
        
        <h3>1. Knee Replacement</h3>
        <p>Knee replacement surgery is performed when the knee joint is damaged beyond repair. This procedure involves removing damaged cartilage and bone and replacing it with a prosthetic joint. We offer both partial and total knee replacement options.</p>

        <h3>2. Hip Replacement</h3>
        <p>Hip replacement surgery is one of the most common procedures we perform. It involves replacing the worn-out or damaged hip joint with a prosthetic. This surgery can alleviate chronic hip pain and improve joint function dramatically.</p>

        <h3>3. Shoulder Replacement</h3>
        <p>Shoulder replacement surgery is performed to replace the shoulder joint with a prosthetic. This is commonly done for patients with severe arthritis or after a major injury to the shoulder joint.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Elbow Replacement</h3>
        <p>Elbow replacement surgery is recommended for patients suffering from conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or after a severe fracture. The procedure involves replacing the damaged parts of the elbow joint with an artificial joint.</p>

        <h3>5. Ankle Replacement</h3>
        <p>Ankle replacement surgery is less common but highly effective for patients suffering from severe arthritis in the ankle. This surgery can help restore mobility and reduce chronic pain.</p>
