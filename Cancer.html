          <h2>What is blood cancer?</h2>
          <p> Cancer is caused by a dysfunction in cellular growth and behavior.
            In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones.
             The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers.  
               </p>

                 Over time, these cells can form a mass of tissue known as a tumor. </p>
