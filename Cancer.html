          <h2>What is blood cancer?</h2>
          <p> Cancer is caused by a dysfunction in cellular growth and behavior.
            In a healthy body, new white blood cells are regularly generated to replace old, dying ones.
             The excessive production of white blood cells in the bone marrow leads to blood cancers.  
               </p>
               <h2>What are the symptoms of blood cancer?</h2>
               <p><b>Symptoms of blood cancer vary by disease but typically include the following:</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fever</li>
                  <li>Chills</li>
                  <li>Fatigue</li>
                  <li>Weakness</li>
                  <li>Bone and joint pain</li>
                  <li>Weight loss</li>

                <ul>
                   <li><b>Chemotherapy :</b></li>
                    Uses drugs to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. It can be given as an injection, tablet, or intravenously.
                </ul>

                  <li> <b>Stem cell transplant : </b></li>
                  Replaces abnormal stem cells with healthy ones. There are two types of stem cell transplants:
                  <li><b>Autograft:</b> Uses your own stem cells</li>
                  <li><b>Allograft:</b> Uses a donor's stem cells</li>

               <h2>What is lung cancer?</h2>
              <p>Lung cancer refers to different types of cancer that develop within the lungs. 
                 Like all cancers, lung cancer begins at the cellular level and causes abnormal cells in the lungs to reproduce rapidly and out of control.
                 Over time, these cells can form a mass of tissue known as a tumor. </p>
              <h2>What are the symptoms of lung cancer? </h2>
              <p><b>Most people who are diagnosed with lung cancer experience one or more of the following symptoms:</b></p>
              <ul>
               <li>Chest pain that flares up while coughing or laughing</li>
               <li>A cough that doesn't go away and that worsens over time</li>
               <li>Wheezing</li>
               <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
               <li>Hoarseness</li>
               <li>Loss of appetite </li>
            </ul>
       
            <h2>How is lung cancer treated?</h2>
            <img src="lung treated.jpg" height="200px" width="300">
            <ul>
             <li><b> Surgery :</b></li>
             An operation to remove the cancer. Surgery may not be possible if the cancer is large or has spread to other parts of the body.
             <li><b>Chemotherapy :</b></li>
             The use of special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. Chemotherapy is an important part of treatment for small cell lung cancer, regardless of the stage. 
             <li><b>Targeted therapy :</b></li>
             The use of drugs to block the growth and spread of cancer cells. 
             <li><b>Pneumonectomy :</b></li>
             In a pneumonectomy, a surgeon removes the entirety of the right or the left lung. This procedure is used if the cancer is near the center of the chest.
             </ul>
             <h2>How is lung cancer diagnosed?</h2>
             <p>To diagnose lung cancer, your doctor will obtain your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order different tests that confirm the presence of the disease. 
                Doctors also may order imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest or abdomen, to check for the presence of a tumor or mass in the lungs. </p>
                <b>If they believe that lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including the brain or bones, they may order the following:</b>
            <ul>
             <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</li>
             <li>Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, often combined with a CT scan</li>
             <li>Bone scan</li>
             </ul>
